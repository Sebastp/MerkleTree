> Merkle tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large data structures. Hash trees are a generalization of hash lists and hash chains.

### In the illustration, let’s imagine I know the whole Merkle tree. Someone gives me L2 data block but I don’t
trust him. How can I check if L2 data is valid?
```Compile whole tree again with your new L2 and see if Top Hash Matches your Top Hash```

### I know only the L3 block and the Merkle root. What minimum information do I need to check that the L3
block and the Merkle root belong to the same Merkle tree?
```You need the rest of blocks (L1, L2, L4)```
